                <p>[Your introduction here — what drew you to this project, what you were doing there that night, how the idea formed.]</p>

                <p>[What you noticed about how people were interacting with the memorial — the selfies, the documenting, the influencers posing, the genuine grief, the phones held up like candles or shields.]</p>

                <p>[The recursion of it — photographing people photographing. What does it mean to document an act of documentation? Is witnessing a form of participation or consumption? Both?]</p>

                <p>[Technical notes if you want them — camera, settings, how you approached the shots without being intrusive, the ethics of photographing strangers in a moment of public mourning.]</p>

                <p>[What you learned, what you're still thinking about, what the images don't show.]</p>
